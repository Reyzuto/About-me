# About-me
A Simple Introduction About Myself

# Hello there! I'm Reyzuto

Nice to meet you, I'm not a programmer or anything, I'm just a regular osu!droid player.

## About Me

I'm just an NPC and an osu!droid player in general. My daily life is just playing games and being idle, sometimes I watch anime, I made a github account just because I was bored and didn't know what to do.
